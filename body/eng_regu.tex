\section{Background}
\subsection{Circuit testing}
It is unavoidable that some faults should appear during an integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing.

\subsection{Some text}

To facilitate IC testing, design-for-testability (DFT) technique was proposed to add some specific design structure to improve the testability of CUT\cite{hithesis2017,cnarticle}.
